This is a simple Processing sketch to convert images to .xbm format. Tested with .png files; sample Jaycon logos are included for testing.

Example Processing Code to convert images to .xbm format for our Epaper Displays.

Simply open the sketch in Processing 2.0b6 (http://processing.org/) or greater and select the image you wish to convert. The image will be converted and stored at the same location.

Enjoy!
